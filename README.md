# CrediScore
CrediScore aims to solve the issues of overcollaterized loan in the de-fi space and also help to marginalize the traditional banking system with the decentralized banking system. 

## How it works
Users from different defi protocol can generate a credit score based on their previous transactions, we would aggregate this all together and generate a score based on our system rating, we believe this can be used to generate a more accurate parameter/ metric for lending loans to users.
